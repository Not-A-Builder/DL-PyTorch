    "Each of the 2 collections have nodes responsible for visualising and examining different portions of the image.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also good to have each of the hidden nodes within a collection to have a common group of weights.  \n",
    "The idea is that different regions within the image will share the same kind of information.  \n",
    "In other words, any pattern that's relevant towrads understanding the image, could appear anywhere within the image.  \n",
    "For instance, it is not mandatory for a photo of a cat, to have the face of the cat in the dead centre of the photo. The face could be anywhere, but then it would still be a photo of the cat, and our goal is to properly identify it.  \n",
