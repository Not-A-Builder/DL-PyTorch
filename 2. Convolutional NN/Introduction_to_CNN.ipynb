    "### What are CNN's?\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs, like neural networks, are made up of neurons with learnable weights and biases. Each neuron receives several inputs, takes a weighted sum over them, pass it through an activation function and responds with an output. The whole network has a loss function and all the tips and tricks that had been developed for neural networks still apply on CNNs. \n",
    "\n",

    "### How are Convolutional Neural Networks different than Neural Networks?\n",
    "\n",
    "• CNN's operate over volumes. Unlike neural networks, where the input is a vector, here the input is a multi-channeled image.  \n",
    "• The convolution layer is the main building block of a convolutional neural network.  \n",
    "• For a particular feature map (the output received on convolving the image with a particular filter is called a feature map), each neuron is connected only to a small chunk of the input image and all the neurons have the same connection weights.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Parameter Sharing:\n",
    "Parameter sharing is sharing of weights by all neurons in a particular feature map.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Local Connectivity:\n",
    "Local connectivity is the concept of each neural connected only to a subset of the input image (unlike a neural network where all the neurons are fully connected).  \n",
    "\n",
    "This helps to reduce the number of parameters in the whole system and makes the computation more efficient."
