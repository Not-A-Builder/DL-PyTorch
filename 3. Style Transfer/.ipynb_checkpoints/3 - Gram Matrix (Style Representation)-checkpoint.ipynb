    "A Gram Matrix is just one mathematical way of representing shared and prominent styles.\n",

    "• The style representation fo an image relies on looking at correlations between the individual layers of the VGG19 network.  \n",
    "• In other words, looking at how similar the features in a single layer are.  \n",
    "• Similarities will include the genaral colours and textures found in that layer.  \n",
    "• We typically find these similarities between multiple image in a network.  \n",
    "• By including the correlation between multiple layers of different sizes we can obtain a multi-scale style representation of the input image.\n",
